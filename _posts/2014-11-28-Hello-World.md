title: New Blog! Hello World!
---

I will open my own blog, Finally! I have this idea for a long time, but I am always telling myself the lie that I will start tomorrow. Today I did the same thing, and I say NO WAY! Nothing is there tomorrow, no matter how hard it is, I will start today. no matter how naive my words are, I will start today. 

BTW, this blog is inspired by [this post](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/#comment-1238706), which shows a very easy way to open a static blog on Github. Enjoy!

Well, Hello World!
